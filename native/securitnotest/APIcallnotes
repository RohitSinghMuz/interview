// “To secure API calls, I always use HTTPS and adopt token-based 
// authentication like JWT, storing tokens only in secure storage. 
// I never expose sensitive keys in the frontend and route critical operations 
// through a backend service.

// All APIs are protected with backend validation, authorization, rate limiting, 
// and proper CORS rules. I also use environment variables, avoid exposing secrets, 
// and for advanced cases, implement request signing (HMAC).

// Overall, my approach ensures secure communication, safe token handling,
//  and defense against common attacks.”
